# Hello 👋, I'm Dhanush B M

Data is today's fuel. The sheer power of data drove me to initiate my journey into the mysterious world of Data Science.

Like many others, my initial interest lay in building real-world applications, I was fascinated by building logic for simple programming problems. I realized my passion upon switching to Business Intelligence and analytics. 

My programming, statistics & finance coursework has provided me with the analytical skills I apply to diverse business scenarios. My zeal to learn, coupled with my ability to collaborate and accomplish goals makes me well-suited for a career in the field of Data Science and business analytics. I look forward to the opportunity of being interviewed in order to share more about my experience and the skills that I could bring to any company.
